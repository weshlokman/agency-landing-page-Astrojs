          <!-- Intro -->
          <section>
            <p>
              TikTok Shop has quickly become one of the most powerful e-commerce platforms worldwide, but here’s the catch:
              <strong> TikTok Shop is not officially available in Canada yet.</strong>
              Canadian businesses cannot directly register with a Canadian business license.
              However, many Canadian entrepreneurs are already finding ways to sell on TikTok
              by registering through the United States, unlocking the same opportunities as U.S. sellers.

              In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about
              <strong> TikTok Shop Canada </strong>in 2025 — from requirements to setup, and how you can start selling even
              before the platform officially launches in Canada.

          <!-- Why Canadian Businesses Should Care -->

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-heading-1 mb-4">Why Canadian Businesses Should Care About TikTok Shop</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Market growth:</strong> TikTok Shop generated billions in sales (GMV) across key categories like beauty, wellness, and apparel.</li>
              <li><strong>Influencer partnerships:</strong> Collaborate with U.S. TikTok creators who can drive traffic and sales.</li>
              <li><strong>The Halo Effect:</strong> Exposure on TikTok often increases sales on Amazon, Shopify, and other platforms.</li>
              <li><strong>Early mover advantage:</strong> Canadian businesses that get in now will already have traction when TikTok Shop Canada officially launches.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-heading-1 mb-4">Requirements for Canadian Sellers</h2>
            <p>
              To sell on TikTok Shop as a Canadian business, you’ll need to qualify under
              <strong> U.S. seller requirements </strong>:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li>U.S. LLC or Corporation</li>
              <li>EIN (Employer Identification Number)</li>
              <li>U.S. Bank Account</li>
              <li>U.S. Address or Representative</li>
              <li>
                Stock in the U.S. — While you can technically ship from Canada, you may face
                <strong> longer delivery times </strong> and potential <strong> tariffs or customs fees.</strong>
                Most sellers place inventory in U.S. warehouses or 3PLs for faster shipping and smoother operations.

            <div class="space-y-6">
              <div>
                <h3 class="font-semibold">1. Is TikTok Shop available in Canada?</h3>
                <p>No, TikTok Shop is not officially available in Canada yet. Canadian sellers can still participate by setting up a U.S. business entity and registering as U.S. sellers.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 class="font-semibold">2. Do I need a U.S. company to sell on TikTok Shop from Canada?</h3>
                <p>Yes. You’ll need to form a U.S. LLC or corporation, get an EIN, and open a U.S. bank account to qualify.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 class="font-semibold">3. Can I sell on TikTok Shop without stock in the U.S.?</h3>
                <p>
                  Yes, you can ship from Canada, but it’s not ideal. Cross-border shipping often means slower delivery
                  and potential tariffs or customs fees. Most Canadian sellers store products in U.S. warehouses or 3PLs
                  to ensure faster delivery and a better customer experience.
                </p>

              <div>
                <h3 class="font-semibold">4. How do Canadian sellers get paid on TikTok Shop?</h3>
                <p>TikTok Shop only pays out to U.S. bank accounts, which means Canadian businesses must open a U.S. account (or work with an agency that provides this solution).</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 class="font-semibold">5. When will TikTok Shop officially launch in Canada?</h3>
                <p>TikTok has not announced an official launch date for Canada. However, demand is growing, and many expect expansion after the success in the U.S. and U.K.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 class="font-semibold">6. Can agencies help Canadians get on TikTok Shop?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Some agencies specialize in helping Canadian businesses set up U.S. entities, bank accounts, and TikTok Shop stores to simplify the process.</p>

          <!-- Key Takeaway -->
          <section>
            <p class="mt-6">
              ✅ <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> While <strong>TikTok Shop Canada</strong> isn’t officially live, Canadian entrepreneurs
              don’t have to wait. By setting up in the U.S. — with stock placed in American warehouses to ensure smooth logistics and
              avoid tariffs — you can start selling today and be ready to dominate when the platform eventually expands north.
